This is my internship work on "Bus Matrix Architecture" at DataPlay.

📑Bus Matrix is an essential tool for planning and designing data warehouse architecture. The objective of this project is to create a Business (Bus) Matrix Architecture from the given dataset.

📊 I have selected the Business Goal first, then identified the Business processes and the relevant Dimensions. Finally, constructed the Bus Matrix to show the relationship between the business processes and dimensions.
The work is done in MS Excel worksheet.

🔍 The work is done under the guidance of Soumya Ma'am from DataPlay... I am thankful to my mentors and co-interns for helping me with this project. 😊
